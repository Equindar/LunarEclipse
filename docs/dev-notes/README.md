## Structure
Structuring the notes is always a work in progress until we define some rules and conventions we are happy with and agree on them. Currently we are in the experimental phase. There is no bad or good.
Take a logical approach, reuse whats already set up, reach out for improvements and name things appropriate, that it can be found easily.
## Notes
### Properties
You add properties on notes by typing on the very first line `---`.

Assigning properties help filtering the entire dev-note vault.
> I introduced the properties "state" and "level".
> "State" represents our understanding of the state of a idea/concept for project management. Availabe States are "unstructured" > "structured", "idea" > "draft" > "concept".
> 
> "Level" represents one stage of the [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid) and defines the grade of refinement of the entire note. Available levels are: "data", "information", "knowledge", "wisdom".
